## Introduction 
This is a re-organization of team project from course 15619 Cloud Computing @ Carnegie Mellon University. 
The project is to build a web service for Twitter data analysis. 
About ~1 TB raw twitter data is provided. The dataset will have to be stored within our web service. The web service should be able to handle a specific number of requests per second for several hours. However, the budget is limited, thus the task is to build an effective and cost efficient solution utilizing Amazon Web Services resources.
